# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Tom Marom AKA Shookies.
I'm currently finishing my degree in Mathematics in The Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
and I'm also looking for my first challenge as a software developer. 

# What's here?

I add to this page projects that i'm working on in my spare time, as well as a select few projects from my studies.
My current time-vacuum is building a Reinforcement Learning agent for Starcraft 2 using deepmind's PySC2 library.
